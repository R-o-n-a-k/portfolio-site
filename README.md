## 🚀 About Project

This portfolio site was built as part of an **assignment on FreeCodeCamp** during my early learning days.

It provided a solid foundation in understanding page structure and content management with **HTML & CSS**.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Grid layout, card UI, custom styling)
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## ✨ Features

- Grid-based layout with content cards
- Mobile-responsive design
- Image integration for better visuals
- Portfolio-style sections (projects, contact, etc.)
- Basic interaction and styling with clean design
